Grubbin Deli Shop

This application allows users to fully customize their sandwiches with a wide range of options. Build your sandwich just the way you like it, from the bread, meat, and cheese to the toppings, sauces, and more. You can also add drinks and chips to your order. Once you’ve finished building your order, simply hit checkout to complete it.

At first, I was going for a more linear path once the customer ordered their sandwich, they were immediately asked if they wanted a drink and chips, and then automatically taken to checkout.

Then I realized that doesn't give the user much control over the interface. Some customers will just want a sandwich with no drink or chips. However, if they do want them, they have the option to navigate through the menu rather than being directly offered them.
The diagram didn’t change much because the directions provided in Brightspace for this assignment were pretty straightforward. The only changes I made was giving the user more control on their options

An interesting piece of code is definitely the FileWriter. The fact that Java can create individual .txt files demonstrates the complexity and capability of the application. If it can create a text file, I imagine there are probably many other file types Java can interact with, the possibilities are endless.
